# Deviations from PRJ566 Proposal

This document lists the deviations from the original PRJ566 proposal:

## 1. Feature Changes

- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**  
  Originally proposed, MFA was not implemented in the final system due to time constraints.

- **Account Type Switching**  
  While proposed with verification and approval processes, the feature was not fully implemented.

- **Appointment Confirmation Notifications**  
  The system does not currently send confirmation notifications via email or SMS after appointment bookings.

- **Donation Payment Methods**  
  Although the proposal included support for credit cards, debit cards, and digital wallets, the implemented system only supports credit and debit card payments.

- **Secure Online Payments (PCI DSS Compliance)**  
  A secure payment system was proposed with compliance to industry standards like PCI DSS. Instead, a dummy payment system was used for demonstration purposes.

- **Platform Notifications and Announcements**  
  The proposal included features for users to receive updates, announcements, and notifications. This functionality was not implemented.

- **Messaging and User Interaction**  
  Proposed messaging capabilities and feedback channels between users were not developed. Communication features and engagement data flow components remain unimplemented.

- **Volunteer Scheduling**  
  The feature allowing volunteers to view their assigned shifts under "My Schedule" was not included in the final version.

## 2. Timeline Adjustments

Several proposed features were deprioritized or omitted due to limited development time and project scope adjustments during the course of the semester.

## 3. Technical Stack Changes

No major changes to the technology stack were made, but the use of a dummy payment processor instead of a secure, real-world integration was a deviation from the original technical plan.

## 4. Other Deviations

- **Performance Testing**  
  Load testing and stress testing, which were planned to assess application performance under varying conditions, were not conducted.

- **Compliance Measures**  
  Proposed compliance with data protection regulations and non-profit operation standards was not achieved due to scope constraints.
